# E-Commerce API
---
The project aims to create a powerful and scalable API that supports all essential functionalities for a modern e-commerce platform. This API will allow users to browse products, add them to their cart, and complete the checkout process. Additionally, users can create accounts, save shipping and billing information, and track their orders.

> This implementation is inspired by the [MB Projects E-Commerce Platform API: Build Your Own eBay](https://projects.masteringbackend.com/projects/e-commerce-platform-api-build-your-own-e-bay). For a deeper dive into the design and architecture.
## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Go (Golang)
- **Framework**: [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: [sqlx](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx)
- **Authentication**: JWT (Access and Refresh Tokens)

## Quick start

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/boatman-27/E-Commerce_API
cd E-Commerce_API
```
### 2. Setup environment variables
Create a `.env` file and add your secrets and DB config:
``` env
# ----------------------------
	# Database Configuration
# ----------------------------
POSTGRES_DSN="user=<DB_USERNAME> password=<DB_PASSWORD> dbname=<DB_NAME> sslmode=disable"

# ----------------------------
# Application Email Configuration
# ----------------------------
# Email used for sending notifications, verifications, etc.
APP_EMAIL="your-email@gmail.com"

# Email-specific password or token
APP_PASSWORD="<APP_PASSWORD_OR_TOKEN>"

# Access & Refresh token secrets
ACCESS_SECRET=your_access_secret
REFRESH_SECRET=your_refresh_secret

# ----------------------------
# Notes:
# 1. Replace placeholders with your actual credentials.
# 2. For Gmail, create an App Password instead of using your main password.
```
### 3. Install CompileDaemon (Optional)
Once installed, you can use `CompileDaemon` to watch your project files and recompile/run your Go application automatically on changes.
```Bash
go install github.com/githubnemo/CompileDaemon@latest
```

Add `export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"` to your `shell` file (`.zshrc` or `.bashrc`)
### 4. Add an alias in your `shell` file
```bash
alias gomon="CompileDaemon -build='go build -o myapp main.go' -command='./myapp'"
```
### 5. Run the application
```bash
# With CompileDaemon
gomon

# Or without
go run .
```
