BSUECDR3U6H37CCZERVYSTTF   This project is a Pomodoro timer application designed to improve time management and productivity. The Pomodoro Technique, a popular time management method, breaks work into intervals separated by short breaks. This application implements this technique by allowing users to set customizable durations for work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks. The timer functionality enables users to start and reset the timer as needed. It alternates between work intervals and breaks, with visual cues indicating the current timer state, whether it's time to work or take a break. Additionally, checkmarks are displayed to mark completed work intervals, providing users with a sense of progress. Incorporating a to-do list feature, users can input tasks directly into the application. Tasks are displayed on the user interface, allowing users to manage their tasks alongside the timer. Tasks can be added, checked off upon completion, and removed as needed, facilitating task organization and prioritization. To ensure seamless user experience, the application utilizes file persistence to store the to-do list. This ensures that tasks remain intact across different sessions, allowing users to pick up where they left off without losing any important information. Built using Tkinter, a Python GUI toolkit, the application boasts a user-friendly interface that is intuitive and easy to navigate. With its combination of timer functionality and task management features, this Pomodoro timer application provides users with a powerful tool for enhancing productivity and time management skills.
