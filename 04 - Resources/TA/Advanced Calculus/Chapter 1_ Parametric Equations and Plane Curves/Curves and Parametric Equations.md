## Curves and Parametric Equations
### Definition
A parametric equation represents a curve by expressing its coordinates as functions of an independent parameter $t$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
    x &= f(t), \\
    y &= g(t), \quad t \in [a, b].
\end{aligned}
$$
This formulation is useful for describing motion, complex shapes, and curves that may not be functions in Cartesian form.

### Advantages of Parametric Equations
1. **Flexibility** – They describe curves that cannot be expressed as functions of \( x \) alone.
2. **Motion Representation** – The parameter $t$ can represent time, allowing for dynamic interpretations.
3. **Simplifies Complex Curves** – Certain curves like circles and ellipses have simpler parametric representations than Cartesian ones.

### Common Parametric Curves
#### Circle
$$
\begin{aligned}
    x &= r \cos t, \\
    y &= r \sin t, \quad t \in [0, 2\pi].
\end{aligned}
$$
This describes a circle of radius \( r \) centered at the origin.

#### Ellipse
$$
\begin{aligned}
    x &= a \cos t, \\
    y &= b \sin t, \quad t \in [0, 2\pi].
\end{aligned}
$$
For $a \neq b$, the ellipse is elongated along the $x-$ or $y-$axis.

#### Cycloid
A cycloid is generated by a point on the circumference of a rolling circle of radius $r$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
    x &= r(t - \sin t), \\
    y &= r(1 - \cos t), \quad t \in \mathbb{R}.
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Lissajous Curve
Lissajous curves arise from harmonic motion in perpendicular directions:
$$
\begin{aligned}
    x &= A \sin (at + \delta), \\
    y &= B \sin(bt), \quad t \in \mathbb{R}.
\end{aligned}
$$
These curves depend on the frequency ratios $a/b$ and phase shift $\delta$.

### Derivatives and Tangents of Parametric Curves
The slope of the tangent line at a point on a parametric curve is:
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{dy}{dt}}{\frac{dx}{dt}}, \quad \text{provided } \frac{dx}{dt} \neq 0.
$$
The second derivative is given by:
$$
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{dy}{dx} \right)}{\frac{dx}{dt}}.
$$

### Example: Tangent to a Parabola
For the curve $x = t^2, y = t^3$:
$$
\frac{dx}{dt} = 2t, \quad \frac{dy}{dt} = 3t^2.
$$
Thus, the slope of the tangent line is:
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{3t^2}{2t} = \frac{3t}{2}, \quad t \neq 0.
$$

This provides a deeper understanding of parametric equations and their applications.
