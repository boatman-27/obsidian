Numerical differentiation and integration are essential techniques in numerical analysis. They are used to approximate derivatives and integrals when analytical solutions are difficult or impossible to obtain. These methods play a crucial role in scientific computing, engineering, and applied mathematics.

## Numerical Differentiation

[[Numerical Differentiation]] approximates the derivative of a function using discrete data points. Common methods include:
- **Forward Difference Formula**: Uses the function value at a point and a nearby point.
- **Backward Difference Formula**: Uses the function value at a point and a previous point.
- **Central Difference Formula**: Uses values on both sides of the point for better accuracy.

These techniques are widely used in solving differential equations, physics simulations, and optimization problems.

## Numerical Integration

[[Numerical integration]] approximates the integral of a function over an interval. Common methods include:
- **Trapezoidal Rule**: Approximates the area under the curve using trapezoids.
- **Simpson’s Rule**: Uses parabolic segments for a more accurate approximation.

Numerical integration is commonly applied in physics, engineering, and probability calculations.

## Conclusion

Numerical differentiation and integration provide practical solutions for problems where analytical methods are infeasible. By using these techniques, we can approximate solutions with varying levels of accuracy, depending on the method chosen.
