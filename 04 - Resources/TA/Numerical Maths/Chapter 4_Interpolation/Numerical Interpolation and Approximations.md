Interpolation is a fundamental concept in numerical mathematics and data analysis. It involves constructing new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points. Interpolation techniques are widely used in engineering, computer graphics, scientific computing, and many other fields.

## Topics Covered

### 1. [[Linear Regression]]
Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. It is often used for predictive analysis and trend estimation.

### 2. [[Taylor Series Approximation]]
The Taylor series is a mathematical representation of a function as an infinite sum of terms, calculated from the function's derivatives at a single point. It provides a way to approximate functions using polynomials, making it useful for interpolation and numerical analysis.

### 3. [[Lagrange Interpolation]]
Lagrange interpolation is a polynomial interpolation method that constructs a polynomial passing through a given set of points. It is particularly useful when an explicit function is not known, and only discrete data points are available.

### 4. [[Spline Interpolation]]
Spline interpolation involves piecewise polynomial functions, typically cubic splines, to create a smooth curve through a set of data points. Unlike high-degree polynomial interpolation, splines prevent excessive oscillations and provide better accuracy in practical applications.

Each of these methods has its advantages and specific use cases, making them essential tools in numerical analysis and scientific computing.
