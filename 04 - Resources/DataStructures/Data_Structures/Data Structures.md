## 1. Overview

Data structures are fundamental components of computer science that help organize and store data efficiently. Choosing the right data structure can optimize performance and simplify problem-solving in algorithms.

## 2. **Data Structures**

### Linear Data Structures
Linear data structures store elements sequentially, allowing easier traversal and manipulation.
- **Arrays**: Fixed-size collections of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.
    - **Topics to Learn**:
        - Static vs. dynamic arrays
        - Applications in sliding window, prefix sum, searching algorithms
- **Linked Lists**: Nodes connected via pointers, allowing efficient insertion/deletion.
    - **Types**:
        - Singly linked list
        - Doubly linked list
        - Circular linked list
    - **Operations**:
        - Insertion, deletion, reversal
- **Stacks & Queues**: Abstract data types with specific access rules.
    - **Stack**:
        - Follows LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle
        - Used in function calls, backtracking, and parentheses matching
    - **Queue**:
        - Follows FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle
        - Used in scheduling, BFS traversal, and caching
### Non-Linear Data Structures
Non-linear data structures store elements in hierarchical or interconnected ways.
- **Hashing**: Efficient key-value storage using hash functions.
    - **Concepts**:
        - Hash tables & hash maps
        - Collision handling (chaining, open addressing)
- **Trees**: Hierarchical structures where each node has a parent and children.
    - **Types**:
        - Binary trees
        - Binary search trees (BST)
        - Segment trees
        - Tries (prefix trees)
    - **Operations**:
        - Traversal techniques: Depth-First Search (DFS) & Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- **Graphs**: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
    - **Representations**:
        - Adjacency list
        - Adjacency matrix
    - **Graph Algorithms**:
        - Traversals: DFS, BFS
        - Shortest Path: Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford
        - Minimum Spanning Tree: Kruskal's, Prim's
## 3. **Why Learn Data Structures?**
- Optimize performance for computational problems
- Essential for competitive programming & technical interviews
- Provides the foundation for advanced topics like machine learning and databases
