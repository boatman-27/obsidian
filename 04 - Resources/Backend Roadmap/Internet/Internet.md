The *internet* is a global network of interconnected devices that communicate together using standardised protocols, mainly TCP/IP. 

When a user requests a webpage, their device sends a data packet through the Internet Service Provider(ISP) to a DNS server which translates the domain name into an IP address. 

That packet is then routed across various networks using routers and switches to the destination server, which processes the request and sends back the response. 

This back-and-forth always for the transfer of data like web pages, emails, and files through the internet. 

Information on the Internet moves from one computer to another in the form of bits over various [[mediums]], including Ethernet cables, fiber optic cables, and wireless signals (i.e., radio waves).

An [[Internet Protocol]] address (IP address) is a numerical label such as 192.0.2.1 that is assigned to a computer network that uses IP for communication. They serve two main functions network interface identification and location addressing. 

Information transfer on the Internet from one computer to another does not need to follow a fixed path; in fact, it may change paths during the transfer.

This information transfer is done in the form of packets and these [[packets]] may follow different routes depending on certain factors.

[[HTTP]] is the standard protocol by which webpages are transferred over the Internet.
