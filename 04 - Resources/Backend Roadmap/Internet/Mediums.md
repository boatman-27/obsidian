## 1. Ethernet Cables

### How They Work
Ethernet cables transmit data using electrical signals through twisted pairs of copper wires. Devices are connected via these cables to form a local area network (LAN), allowing them to communicate through a router or switch.
### Uses
- Home and office networks
- Desktop computers, routers, gaming consoles
- Connecting LAN devices in buildings
### Pros
- **Stable connection:** Less prone to interference
- **Low latency:** Great for gaming and video calls
- **Affordable:** Inexpensive and widely available
### Cons
- **Limited range:** Dependent on cable length
- **Cable clutter:** Can create messy environments
- **Slower than fiber:** Especially at long distances

## 2. Fiber Optic Cables

### How They Work
Fiber optic cables transmit data as pulses of light through strands of glass or plastic fiber. This method allows for extremely fast data transmission over long distances with minimal loss.
### Uses
- High-speed internet backbone
- Data centers and ISPs
- Long-distance communication
### Pros
- **High speed:** Much faster than copper cables
- **Long-distance transmission:** Low signal degradation
- **Immunity to EMI:** Not affected by electrical interference

### Cons
- **Expensive:** Costly installation and maintenance
- **Fragile:** Can break more easily than copper cables
- **Specialized handling:** Requires professional installation

## 3. Wireless Signals

### How They Work
Wireless signals use radio frequency (RF) waves to transmit data through the air. Devices connect to a wireless access point or router, which handles the data transmission to and from the internet or other networked devices.
### Uses
- Mobile devices (phones, tablets, laptops)
- IoT devices and smart homes
- Public hotspots and remote areas
### Pros
- **High mobility:** No physical connections needed
- **Easy setup:** Minimal infrastructure required
- **Scalable:** Supports many devices easily
### Cons
- **Interference issues:** Can be affected by walls, other devices
- **Security risks:** More vulnerable to hacking
- **Variable speeds:** Slower and less stable than wired connections
