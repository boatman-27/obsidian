# [Problem 49] Group Anagrams

## Problem Statement

we have an array filled with strings and we need to return an array of arrays, each inside array should all have all the anagrams of that one word

---
## Examples 
### **Example 1:**
	**Input:** strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
	**Output:** [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
	**Explanation:**
		- There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form `"bat"`.
		- The strings `"nat"` and `"tan"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
		- The strings `"ate"`, `"eat"`, and `"tea"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
### **Example 2:**
	**Input:** strs = [""]
	**Output:** [[""]]
### **Example 3:**
	**Input:** strs = ["a"]
	**Output:** [["a"]]

---
## Approaches 

okay so hashmap, but it will map the sorted words to their anagrams. so we for loop through the array of strings and sort each word alphabetically and then append it to the key array 

---
## Code (in Go)
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sort"
)

func sortString(s string) string {
	// Convert to slice of runes (to handle Unicode properly)
	runes := []rune(s)
	sort.Slice(runes, func(i, j int) bool {
		return runes[i] < runes[j]
	})
	return string(runes)
}

func groupAnagrams(strs []string) [][]string {
	anagrams := make(map[string][]string)
	for _, word := range strs {
		new := sortString(word)
		anagrams[new] = append(anagrams[new], word)
	}

	result := make([][]string, 0, len(anagrams))
	for _, arrays := range anagrams {
		result = append(result, arrays)
	}
	return result
}

func main() {
	strs := []string{"eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"}
	fmt.Println(groupAnagrams(strs))
}
```
