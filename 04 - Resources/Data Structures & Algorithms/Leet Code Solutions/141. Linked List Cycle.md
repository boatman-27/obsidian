# [Problem 141] Linked List Cycle

## Problem Statement

we have the head of a list and we need to find if we can make a cycle. a cycle exists if we can connect the tail to a node at a given position, the position(index) will be given but not as a parameter.

## Examples 
### **Example 1:**

**Input:** head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

### **Example 2:**

**Input:** head = [1,2], pos = 0
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

### **Example 3:**

**Input:** head = [1], pos = -1
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

## Approaches 
since we are given the head, looking at example 3, if head.next is nil then return false, if head is nil then return false.
