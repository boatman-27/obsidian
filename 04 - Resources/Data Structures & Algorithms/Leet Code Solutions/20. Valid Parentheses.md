# [Problem 20] Valid Parentheses

## Problem Statement

we have a string `s` containing different parentheses`'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, we need to see if the string is valid, which means they:
1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

## Approaches 
i was thinking of using a stack, entering the parentheses at the top and we should have a hashmap as well, to match opening and closing
