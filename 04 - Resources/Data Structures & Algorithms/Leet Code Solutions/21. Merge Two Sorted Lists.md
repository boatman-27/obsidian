# [Problem 21] Merge Two Sorted Lists

## Problem Statement

we have 2 sorted lists and we need to combine them into one sorted list, return the head of the combined list...

## Examples 
### **Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/merge_ex1.jpg)

**Input:** list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
**Output:** [1,1,2,3,4,4]
### **Example 2:**
**Input:** list1 = [], list2 = []
**Output:** []
### **Example 3:**

**Input:** list1 = [], list2 = [0]
**Output:** [0]
my brain instantly jumps to merge sort, where when we combine both arrays we check the head (first element) of both and push into the new array and pop it from the old one.

then when one the arrays finish we go through the other adding all elements from the remaining list.
