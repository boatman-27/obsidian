# [Problem 104] Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

## Problem Statement
given the root of a binary tree, we need to find the depth.
A binary tree's **maximum depth** is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

## Examples 
### **Example 1:**
**Input:** root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
**Output:** 3
### **Example 2:**
**Input:** root = [1,null,2]
**Output:** 2

## Approaches 
if root is nil then return 0, else we iteratively run through left and right sides till we find the deepest
