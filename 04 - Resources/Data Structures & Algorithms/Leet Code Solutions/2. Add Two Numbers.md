**Input:** l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
**Output:** [7,0,8]
**Explanation:** 342 + 465 = 807.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
**Output:** [0]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
**Output:** [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

## Approaches 

we go through both lists adding both values, if the sum is greater than 10 we do sum - 10 and we carry over to the next node
