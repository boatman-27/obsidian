# [Problem 88] Merge Sorted Array

## Problem Statement
we have 2 arrays, both sorted in ascending order and we are given the number of nonzero elements `m` and `n` of each array, we need to return the sorted merged array.

the length of result array will be `m + n`. 

### mistake
array 1 has length of `m + n`, where the first m elements are nonzero and the rest are zero, we need to sort array 1 and array 2 IN array 1

---
## Examples 
### **Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
**Output:** [1,2,2,3,5,6]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

### **Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
**Output:** [1]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].

### **Example 3:**

**Input:** nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
**Output:** [1]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

## Approaches 

we will follow the same merge sort approach but checking which is bigger from the m-1 element in array 1 and n-1 in array 2, bc we know that they are sorted so that means the last elements are the largest, if arr1[m-1] > arr2[n-1] then place it in the last element in arr1 [m+n-1] and so on as long as m-1 and n-1 are both greater than zero 

then if any remain in arr2 then we add from last to first

## Code (in Go)
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func merge(nums1 []int, m int, nums2 []int, n int) {
	if len(nums1) == m {
		return
	}

	if len(nums1) == n {
		copy(nums1, nums2)
	}

	i, j, k := m-1, n-1, m+n-1

	for j >= 0 && i >= 0 {
		if nums1[i] >= nums2[j] {
			nums1[k] = nums1[i]
			i--
		} else {
			nums1[k] = nums2[j]
			j--
		}
		k--
	}

	for j >= 0 {
		nums1[k] = nums2[j]
		j--
		k--
	}

	fmt.Println(nums1)
}

func main() {
	nums1 := []int{1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0}
	nums2 := []int{2, 5, 6}

	merge(nums1, 3, nums2, 3)
}
```
