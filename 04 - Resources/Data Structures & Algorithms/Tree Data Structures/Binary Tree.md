A Binary Tree is a type of tree data structure where each node can have a maximum of two child nodes, a left child node and a right child node.

This restriction, that a node can have a maximum of two child nodes, gives us many benefits:

- Algorithms like traversing, searching, insertion and deletion become easier to understand, to implement, and run faster.
- Keeping data sorted in a Binary Search Tree (BST) makes searching very efficient.
- Balancing trees is easier to do with a limited number of child nodes, using an AVL Binary Tree for example.
- Binary Trees can be represented as arrays, making the tree more memory efficient.
