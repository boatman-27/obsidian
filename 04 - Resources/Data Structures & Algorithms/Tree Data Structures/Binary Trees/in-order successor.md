Dear Students, 

I hope you are doing well.

Please note that the assignment has been uploaded. The submission deadline is on **Tuesday,** **16th of December at 17:00**, and **no late submissions will be accepted**.

All submissions must be uploaded **exclusively on Moodle**. **Email submissions will not be accepted.**

You may use any programming language you prefer. However, you are **not allowed to use any library that directly computes the final result**. You are expected to implement the numerical methods yourselves.

Your code must work for **any valid function** provided during testing. Make sure your variables are clearly named and your logic is well-structured.

kind regards, 

Adham Osman
