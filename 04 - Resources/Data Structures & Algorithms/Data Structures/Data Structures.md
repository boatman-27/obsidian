## Overview
Data structures are fundamental components of computer science that help organize and store data efficiently. Choosing the right data structure can optimize performance and simplify problem-solving in algorithms.

### Linear Data Structures
- **[[Arrays]]**: Learn about static and dynamic arrays, and their usage in algorithms like sliding window, prefix sum, and searching.
- **[[Linked Lists]]**: Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists, along with operations like insertion, deletion, and reversal.
- **[[Stacks]] & [[Queues]]**: Implementation using arrays or linked lists, and applications like parentheses matching, backtracking, and BFS/DFS.
### Non-Linear Data Structures
- **Hashing**: Learn how hash tables, hash maps, and collision handling techniques work.
- **Trees**: Study binary trees, binary search trees (BST), tree traversals (DFS, BFS), segment trees, and tries.
- **Graphs**: Understanding graph representations (adjacency list/matrix), graph traversal techniques (DFS, BFS), shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford), minimum spanning trees (Kruskal, Prim), and more.
