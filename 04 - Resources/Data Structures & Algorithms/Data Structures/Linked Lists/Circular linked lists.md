A **circular linked list** is like a singly or doubly linked list with the first node, the "head", and the last node, the "tail", connected.

In singly or doubly linked lists, we can find the start and end of a list by just checking if the links are null. But for circular linked lists, more complex code is needed to explicitly check for start and end nodes in certain applications.

Circular linked lists are good for lists you need to cycle through continuously.

The image below is an example of a singly circular linked list:
