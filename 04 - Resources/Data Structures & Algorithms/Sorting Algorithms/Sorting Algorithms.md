A ***Sorting Algorithm*** is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements in an order. For example, a given array [10, 20, 5, 2] becomes [2, 5, 10, 20] after sorting in increasing order and becomes [20, 10, 5, 2] after sorting in decreasing order.

## Why Do We Sort?
- To organize data for **efficient searching** (e.g., binary search).
- To make data **readable and structured**.
- To prepare for **other algorithms** that assume sorted input.
- To simplify tasks like ranking, scheduling, and indexing.

## Sorting Algorithms
- *Comparison based*: Compare elements (e.g., Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort).
- *Non-comparison-based*: Use keys/buckets (e.g., Counting Sort, Radix Sort).
