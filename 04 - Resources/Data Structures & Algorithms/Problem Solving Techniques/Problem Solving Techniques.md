**Problem Solving Techniques** is a topic that explore various methods used to solve problems in computing and mathematics. They are approaches and procedures that help in the systematic identification and resolution of complex issues. 

Some of these techniques include **Divide and Conquer** where a problem is split into subproblems to make it easier to solve, **Dynamic Programming** which solves problems by dividing them into smaller similar sub-problems and storing the solutions of these subproblems to avoid unnecessary calculations, **Greedy Algorithms** which make the globally optimal choice at each step, **Backtracking** is used when problem can be solved incrementally, **Branch and Bound** method is used for optimization problems. 

These techniques are designed to efficiently solve problems by significantly reducing the time and computational effort required.

[[Brute Force]] is a straightforward method to solve problems. It involves trying every possible solution until the right one is found.
