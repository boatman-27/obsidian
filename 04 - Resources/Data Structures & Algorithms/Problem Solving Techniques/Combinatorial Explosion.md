A *combinatorial explosion* is the phenomenon where a small increase in the number of components or options in a problem leads to a massive, often exponential, increase in the total number of possible combinations, quickly overwhelming computational or human ability to analyze them. This rapid growth makes many problems intractable, meaning they cannot be solved within reasonable time or resource limits. 
### How it happens
- **Multiplying Possibilities:**
    Each additional item or option can be combined in new ways with existing ones, creating many more possibilities. 
- **Example:**
    In a game with ten weapons, each of which can be combined with others, adding just a few more players quickly creates a huge number of potential team compositions or item combinations.
### Consequences
- **Intractability:**
    Problems become too complex to solve exhaustively, even with powerful computers. 
- **Computational Limits:**
    The number of computations needed can quickly reach the limits of available resources. 
### Why it matters
- **Design Challenges:**
    In fields like software engineering or systems design, a combinatorial explosion can result in an unmanageably large number of potential configurations or interactions.
