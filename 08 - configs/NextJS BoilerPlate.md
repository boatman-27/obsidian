# Next.js Boilerplate

A modern **Next.js** starter project to kickstart your future apps with **authentication**, **protected routes**, and a solid **UI foundation**.

---
> **Authentication and user management** (registration, login, JWT tokens, refresh, logout, validation, editing user data, and changing password) are handled in a separate repository.  
> Kindly refer to [JWT_GO](https://github.com/boatman-27/JWT_GO) for full authentication implementation.

## Features

**Next.js 14+** — built with the latest best practices.  
**Reusable Navbar & Sidebar** — responsive layout for quick navigation.  
**Protected Routes** — simple `RequireAuth` component to secure pages.  
**Multifunctional Button** — a flexible button component for various actions.  
**User Context** — global state management for the authenticated user.  
**Full Authentication Flow**:

- Persist sessions (user stays signed in on refresh)
- Validate user tokens  
    **Profile Management**:
- Edit user profile
- Change password

## Prerequisites

This boilerplate relies on a **separate authentication microservice** for user registration, login, JWT validation, etc.  
Make sure you have the [JWT_GO](https://github.com/boatman-27/JWT_GO) backend cloned, configured, and running **before** you start the Next.js dev server.
- Clone and run the backend: [JWT_GO](https://github.com/boatman-27/JWT_GO)
