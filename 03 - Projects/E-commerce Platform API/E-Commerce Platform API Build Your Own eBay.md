## Project Description

The project aims to create a powerful and scalable API that supports all essential functionalities for a modern e-commerce platform. This API will allow users to browse products, add them to their cart, and complete the checkout process. Additionally, users can create accounts, save shipping and billing information, and track their orders.

### Detailed Description
E-commerce has revolutionized people's shopping, providing convenience and accessibility to many products. This project will build an API that facilitates the entire online shopping experience, from product discovery to order fulfillment. Here’s a more detailed look at how users will interact with the app:
1. **User Registration and Authentication**:
    - **Sign Up**: New users can create an account by providing a username, email, and password. A verification email will confirm the account.
    - **Login**: Registered users can log in using their email and password. Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) enhances security.
2. **Profile and Account Management**:
    - **View and Edit Profile**: Users can update their profile details, including name, email, and contact information.
	    - **Manage Addresses**: Users can add, edit, and delete shipping and billing addresses. This ensures that users have up-to-date information for order deliveries.
3. **Product Browsing and Search**:
    - **Product Listing**: Users can browse a catalog of products categorized by type, brand, or other criteria. Each product listing includes images, descriptions, prices, and availability status.
    - **Search Products**: Users can quickly find what they need by searching for products using keywords, filters, and sorting options.
4. **Shopping Cart Management**:
    - **Add to Cart**: Users can add products to their shopping cart, specify quantities, and choose product options (e.g., size, color).
    - **View and Edit Cart**: Users can view the contents of their cart, update quantities, and remove items.
5. **Checkout Process**:
    - **Order Summary**: Before checking out, users can review their order, including product details, shipping information, and total cost.
    - **Payment Processing**: The API will integrate with payment gateways to process credit card payments, PayPal, and other payment methods.
    - **Order Confirmation**: Users receive an order confirmation with a purchase summary and an estimated delivery date.
6. **Order Tracking**:
    - **Order History**: Users can view past orders, including order details and status.
    - **Track Order**: Users can track the status of their current orders, from processing to shipping and delivery.
7. **Wishlists**:
    - **Create and Manage Wishlists**: Users can save products to one or more wishlists for future purchases.
