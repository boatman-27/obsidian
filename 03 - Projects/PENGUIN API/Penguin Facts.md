## A group of penguins in the water is called a raft but on land they’re called a waddle!

## The black and white “tuxedo” look donned by most penguin species is a clever camouflage called countershading.

## Penguins may huddle together for several reasons, including warmth. 

## Penguins evolved to fly underwater, Most birds have hollow, air-filled bones to help them stay light for flight. Penguins adapted with solid bones instead. This helps them swim because solid bones reduce buoyancy—the tendency to float.

## A penguin’s thick feathers aren’t the only way this bird stays warm, A gland near the base of its tail provides waterproof oil. Penguins spend several hours each day covering their feathers with this oil and give extra attention to the task before swimming.

## Penguins live in many locations and habitats, can find them in Antarctica and Antarctic islands, the Galapagos Islands off the coast of Ecuador, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Peru and Chile.

## Contrary to many popular holiday cartoons, you’ll never see penguins and polar bears together in the wild. That’s because penguins live south of the equator while polar bears north of the equator in Arctic!

## Many male penguins gift female penguins with rocks in order to woo them, which are then used to build nests. 

## The penguin is one of the most streamlined animals in the world, a penguin’s body is tapered at both ends and it has a large head, short neck and elongated body. This streamlined design helps penguins swim fast.
