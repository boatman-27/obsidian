## A penguin’s thick feathers aren’t the only way this bird stays warm, A gland near the base of its tail provides waterproof oil. Penguins spend several hours each day covering their feathers with this oil and give extra attention to the task before swimming.

## Adélie penguins are named after Adélie Land, in turn, named for the wife of French explorer Jules Dumont d’Urville who discovered these penguins in 1840.

## **Macaroni** penguins are named after the flamboyantly dressed group of 18th century aristocrats, the ‘Macaronis’.

## Gentoo penguins are the fastest species – they can reach swimming speeds up to 22 mph. Most penguins manage speeds of between 4-7mph.

## Penguins will mate with the same member of the opposite sex season after season.

## When they’re breeding, penguins are also similarly **loyal** to their nesting site, often the rookery in which they were born.
