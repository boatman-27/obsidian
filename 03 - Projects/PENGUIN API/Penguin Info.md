# Adelie Penguin
**Scientific name:** Pygoscelis adeliae 
**Size:** 5.4 kg (m), 4.7 kg (f)  
**Nest type:** in colonies in the open, use stones to line nest  
**Favourite food:** krill  
  
No penguin, indeed no other bird, breeds further south than Adelie Penguins. Adelie Penguins show a number of specialised adaptations to the cold often encountered by this species that restrict heat loss.

**Identification:**  
A medium-sized penguin recognised by its white eye-ring. Feathers on the back of the head are slightly elongated and can be raised to form a small crest. Light-coloured individuals occur rarely in some colonies. Immature birds up to 14 months of age differ from adults in having a white rather than black chin and they lack the white ring around their eyes.  
  
**Habits:**  
Adelie Penguins breed in colonies from a few dozen to many thousands. Within the colonies, distinct sub-colonies can be recognised. The nests, depressions on the ground, are lined with small stones, which help to keep the eggs free of any melt-water from snow. Stones for building nests are often in high demand. They are highly gregarious on land and at sea. The availability of accessible ice-free nesting habitats limits the distribution of this species in the high Antarctic.  
  
**Distribution:** [map](https://www.penguinworld.com/map/map.php "Map")  
Breeds from October to February on shores around the Antarctic continent, South Shetland, South Orkney, South Sandwich, and Bouvetøya Islands. At sea Adelie Penguins are usually found from the edge of the shelf-ice to the northern extent of the pack-ice.  
  
**Migration and Vagrancy:**  
Adelie Penguins are migratory and after breeding do not return to their colonies until the next spring. Little is know about the non-breeding distribution of this species. There are only a few records of Adelie Penguins during the Antarctic winter. Recent work using satellite telemetry indicates that Adelie Penguins from the Ross Sea leave this area in autumn and migrate about 600 km north of the Antarctic continent. Juveniles are suspected to travel even further north than adults. Vagrant birds have been recorded as far north as South Georgia, Falkland Islands, Kerguelen, Macquarie Island, Tasmania, Heard Island, and the South Island of New Zealand.  
  
**Diet:**  
They are highly dependent on krill, usually Euphausia superba, although in some areas E. crystallorophias constitutes the dominant krill species. Fish and amphipods can be common in certain locations at certain seasons.

# African Penguin
**Scientific name:** _Spheniscus demersus_  
**Size:** 3.3 kg (m), 3.0 kg (f)  
**Nest type:** burrow or under bushes/rocks  
**Favourite food:** small fish  
  
This is the only penguin breeding in Africa and was probably the first penguin encountered by Europeans. Numbers declined significantly during the Twentieth Century and their future has been jeopardized recently by major oil spills.  
  

![](https://www.penguinworld.com/types/african_files/africanl-2.jpg)

**Identification:**  
The only penguin occurring regularly in southern Africa. African Penguins, like [Humboldt Penguins](https://www.penguinworld.com/types/humboldt.html "Humboldt"), differ from [Magellanic Penguins](https://www.penguinworld.com/types/magellanic.html "Magellanic") in that they lack a second dark breast band (although some African Penguins do have an additional breast band). The area of naked skin reaches all around the eye and is more extensive than that in Humboldt Penguins. Immature African Penguins have a grey face and lack the pied pattern of adults. Adult plumage occurs after 14 months.  
  
**Habits:**  
African Penguins breed in burrows, rock crevices and under shrubs, often forming large colonies, with some numbering over ten thousand pairs. Breeding is poorly synchronised. Their loud braying voice led to them also being called Jackass Penguins. Birds forage close inshore, especially during the breeding season.  
  
**Distribution:** [map](https://www.penguinworld.com/map/map.php "Map")  
As the name suggests, the African Penguin is endemic to southern Africa with the largest concentrations along the Benguela Current, which brings nutrient-rich water to the west coast of South Africa and Namibia.  
  
**Migration and Vagrancy:**  
Non-migratory. Vagrants have been found as far north as Setta Cama, Gabon, and Inhaca Island, Mozambique.  
  
**Diet:**  
Mainly fish (over 80%), in particular anchovy. Cephalopods and crustaceans are taken as well, but to a much lesser extent.

# Chinstrap Penguin
**Scientific name:** _Pygoscelis antarctica_  
  
**Size:** 5.0 kg (m), 4.8 kg (f)  
**Nest type:** in colonies in the open  
**Favourite food:** krill  
  
This delicately coloured bird is arguably the most beautiful of penguins. In contrast to other adult penguins, apart from Royal Penguins, this species has a white face. This is separated from the white belly by a thin dark line running under the lower part of the chin - therefore the name.  
  

![](https://www.penguinworld.com/types/chinstrap_files/chinstrapl-2.jpg)

**Identification:**  
Chinstrap Penguins are medium-sized penguins, easily recognised by their white face and the fine black line across the cheeks. The demarcation between the black and white lies above the eye, isolating the dark eye in the white plumage. The bill is black. In contrast to most other penguins, juvenile Chinstraps closely resemble their parents. Until their first moult, juveniles can be recognised by dark spotting around the eyes and a slightly shorter bill.  
  
**Habits:**  
Usually breeds on hillside slopes and rocky outcrops in colonies that sometimes can be enormous. At the South Shetlands, Chinstrap Penguins often breed amongst other _[Pygoscelis](https://www.penguinworld.com/types/pygoscelis.html "Pygoscelis")_ penguins, though usually on steeper slopes. Their marine distribution seems to be linked with the limits of the continental shelf and the confluence of the Antarctic circumpolar and Weddell Sea currents.  
  
**Distribution:** [map](https://www.penguinworld.com/map/map.php "Map")  
Intermediate between the Adelie in the south and the Gentoo Penguin in the north. Breeding colonies are almost exclusively on the Scotia Arc: that is, around the Antarctic Peninsula on South Georgia, South Orkney, South Shetland, and South Sandwich Islands (vast numbers on the latter). Small numbers also breed on Bouvetøya, Peter First, Heard and Balleny Islands.  
  
**Migration and Vagrancy:**  
Chinstrap Penguins leave their breeding colonies during winter, probably migrating north of the pack-ice and stay at sea until the next spring. Non-breeders have been recorded in Adelie Land, Antarctica and stragglers have reached Australia and Tierra del Fuego.  
  
**Diet:**  
Chinstrap Penguins feed almost exclusively on krill (Euphasia superba). Other crustaceans and fish play a minor role.

# Emperor Penguin
**Scientific name:** _Aptenodytes forsteri_  
**Size:** 36.7 kg (m), 28.4kg (f)  
**Nest type:** breed on sea ice in winter, egg carried on feet  
**Favourite food:** fish and squid  
  
The Emperor Penguin is a bird of extremes in just about every way. It breeds during the Antarctic winter and exhibits many adaptations to the extreme cold that these birds experience when breeding.  
  

![](https://www.penguinworld.com/types/emperor_files/emperorl-2.jpg)

**Identification:**  
The Emperor Penguin is bigger than any other living penguin, standing up to 1.1 m tall. It is distinguished from the smaller King Penguin by its size, more robust stature, and a broad pale yellow connection between the orange-yellow ear patches and the pale yellow upper breast. Immature birds resemble adults but are smaller and have a white rather than black chin. Ear patches are whitish, becoming increasingly yellow with age.  
  
**Habits:**  
Breeds during the Antarctic winter from March to December. Eggs and chicks are balanced on the feet to prevent them from coming into contact with the ice. No nests are built, which allows the colony to move around and huddle close together, providing some protection from the cold. The male is solely responsible for the two-month incubation of the egg during the heart of winter in almost continuous darkness. If the female has not returned by the time of hatching, the male is able to feed the chick for a short time with a “milk” secreted from the oesophagus.  
  
**Distribution:** [map](https://www.penguinworld.com/map/map.php "Map")  
Breeds during the Antarctic winter in about 30 colonies around the southern parts of the Antarctic continent, usually on fast ice. Probably depends a lot upon polynias – areas of open water surrounded by sea ice – during winter.  
  
**Migration and Vagrancy:**  
Little is known about post-breeding dispersal or migration. Adults stay close to the permanent ice for most of their lives. Juveniles equipped with satellite transmitters, however, migrated as far north as the polar front. Vagrants have turned up on the South Shetland Islands, Tierra del Fuego, the Falklands, South Sandwich Islands, Kerguelen Island, Heard Island, and New Zealand.  
  
**Diet:**  
Fish, cephalopods and krill are taken to varying degrees, though cephalopods and fish probably represent the major components of the diet, especially in terms of mass.

# Erect-crested Penguin
**Scientific name:** _Eudyptes sclateri_  
  
**Size:** 5.2 kg (m), 5.1 kg (f)  
**Nest type:** in colonies in the open; nest on rocks with little to no nesting material to line nests  
**Favourite food:** krill and squid  
  
A little-known rather bizarre bird with a limited breeding distribution in a very isolated part the world.  
  

![](https://www.penguinworld.com/types/erect_files/erectl-2.jpg)

**Identification:**  
Similar to other crested penguins, in particular Snares and Fiordland Penguins. When dry on land Erect-crested Penguin can be identified by the upright yellow feather plumes of their crests. Erect-crested Penguins have a distinct gular pouch, a more parallel bill, and the yellow supercilium attaches higher on the bill than in Snares and Fiordland Penguins. Identification at sea is extremely difficult because feather plumes droop down when wet. Immatures have a pale yellow supercilium without the long plumes and a mottled grey throat. They can be distinguished from other crested penguins by the lower supercilium, size and gular pouch.  
  
**Habits:**  
Erect-crested Penguins breed on rocky slopes bordering the shore. A few pairs build nests but most lay their eggs onto the bare rock. After a long courtship period two eggs are laid but the first, much smaller, A-egg is invariably lost, in most cases on the same day or before the B-egg has been laid.  
  
**Distribution:** [map](https://www.penguinworld.com/map/map.php "Map")  
In an arc that characterizes the distribution of crested penguins, from the Antarctic Peninsula and South America through the sub-Antarctic islands in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, Erect-crested Penguins form the terminal species in the east. They are now restricted to the Bounty and Antipodes Islands, with a few isolated pairs still breeding on the Auckland Islands. All these sites are south of the subtropical convergence but well north of the polar front. Until recently there were also some birds breeding on Campbell Island, but they seem to have disappeared from there now. Abundant sub-fossil material from the Chatham Islands has also been attributed to this species.  
  
**Migration and Vagrancy:**  
Erect-crested Penguins do not come to land after their post-breeding moult and their winter distribution at sea is unknown. Some birds moult regularly on other sub-Antarctic Islands south of New Zealand and, less commonly, on the South Island of New Zealand. Vagrants have been recorded from Northland (North Island of New Zealand), Tasmania, southern Australia, Heard Island and the Falkland Islands.  
  
**Diet:**  
Diet has never been studied in this species, but judging from its long foraging trips, like other crested penguins they probably live mainly on pelagic crustaceans and fish.

# Fiordland Penguin
**Scientific name:** _Eudyptes pachyrhynchus_  
  
**Size:** 4.1 kg (m), 3.7 kg (f)  
**Nest type:** in forest under vegetation or rocks; in caves  
**Favourite food:** fish and squid  
  
The Fiordland Penguin lives in the temperate rainforest of the southwest coast of the South Island and Stewart Island, New Zealand, where it is endemic.  
  

![](https://www.penguinworld.com/types/fiordland_files/fiordlandl-2.jpg)

**Identification:**  
Similar to Snares Penguin, with a thick yellow stripe running above the eye and ending in a dropping plume. Distinguished from Snares Penguin by its larger size, a series of white streaks on the cheeks and the lack of a fleshy margin at the base of the bill. Immature birds have a mottled white chin, thinner dull yellow supercilium and probably cannot be safely distinguished from Snares Penguin.  
  
**Habits:**  
Fiordland Penguins breed under high rainforest canopy, in dense shrub, under boulders and in caves. The nests are lined with twigs and grass. Colonies usually consist of loose groups; nests can be several metres apart. All breeding grounds are north of the subtropical convergence. However, this oceanfront is close to most breeding sites and is likely to provide most of the food for breeding birds. The breeding season begins in June during the austral winter. Males fast for 40 to 45 days from arrival until their first foraging trip. The second-laid egg hatches several days before the first egg. The smaller chick from the latter typically dies within a few days due to starvation.  
  
**Distribution:** [map](https://www.penguinworld.com/map/map.php "Map")  
Endemic to New Zealand. Breeds in the cold rainforest of the southwest coast of the South Island down to Stewart Island.  
  
**Migration and Vagrancy:**  
Migrates into the Tasman Sea as indicated by at-sea observations and the occurrence of moulting birds in eastern Australia. Moulting birds regularly occur also on the Snares Islands. Vagrants have been recorded on the Chathams, Campbell and Macquarie Islands, and as far as Western Australia in Australia.  
  
**Diet:**  
From the limited information that is available it appears that the diet can vary considerably between locations. A study from Codfish Island found that small pelagic fish larvae contributed over 80% of the food intake by mass, with the remaining portion made up by squid. On the west coast of the South Island, however, squid made up over 80% of the diet, crustaceans 13% and fish only 2%. Both studies, nevertheless, indicate that Fiordland Penguins mainly forage in pelagic waters undertaking shallow dives.

# Galapagos Penguin
**Scientific name:** _Spheniscus mendiculus_  
  
**Size:** 2.1 kg (m), 1.7 kg (f)  
**Nest type:** burrow or crevices in lava  
**Favourite food:** small fish  
  
The northernmost of all penguins, Galapagos Penguins breed right on the equator. Populations fluctuate heavily under the influence of El Niño to a degree that the future survival of the species is endangered.  
  

![](https://www.penguinworld.com/types/galapagos_files/galapagosl-2.jpg)

**Identification:**  
They are the smallest of the _Spheniscus_ penguins. Distinguished by their relatively large bill and narrow white line around the face.  
  
**Habits:**  
They breed mainly in caves or crevices of old lava flows and in burrows.  
  
**Distribution:** [map](https://www.penguinworld.com/map/map.php "Map")  
Endemic to the Galapagos Islands where it breeds on Isabela, Fernandina and possibly Bartholomew. Distribution seems to be correlated with the Cromwell Current, which provides cold nutrient-rich surface water.  
  
**Migration and Vagrancy:**  
Galapagos Penguins remain close to their breeding islands throughout the year. A record from the Pacific coast of Panama might well have been ship-assisted.  
  
**Diet:**  
The main prey items taken by Galapagos Penguin are small fish like mullet and sardines.
