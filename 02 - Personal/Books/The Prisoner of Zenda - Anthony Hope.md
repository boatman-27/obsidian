description: Anthony Hope's swashbuckling romance transports his English gentleman hero, Rudolf Rassendyll, from a comfortable life in London to fast-moving adventures in Ruritania, a mythical land steeped in political intrigue. The Prisoner of Zenda has been deservedly popular as a classic of romance and adventure since its publication in 1894.
