description: From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Regretting You, Verity, and It Ends with Us comes a hauntingly seductive tale of love, control, and the devastating secrets that can destroy it all. When Tate Collins moves in with her brother, the last thing she expects is to collide with Miles Archer, a brooding pilot with an unrelenting grip on his past. Their attraction is electric, undeniable, and all-consuming—but Miles has rules. No questions. No future. A no-strings arrangement seems simple at first, but a deep, shattering truth lurks just beneath the surface. Tate soon realizes that Miles is not just guarded but fractured. Torn between desire and self-destruction, his pain bleeds into every part of their dynamic. Miles’s past hides horrors that threaten to rip apart the fragile connection they’ve created, and Tate is forced to make a choice that will change both their lives forever. With suspense simmering underneath every moment of passion, Ugly Love is a whirlwind of lust, heartbreak, and dark revelations that build to a stunning crescendo. For those drawn to the raw tension and psychological complexities of Verity, this is a riveting story where emotions erupt, secrets fester, and love may not be enough to heal the deep scars etched into the past.
