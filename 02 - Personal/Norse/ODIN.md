# Odin – The One-Eyed All-Father

Odin has many names and is the god of both war and death. Half of the warriors who die in battle are taken to his hall of Valhalla. He is the one-eyed All-Father, who sacrificed his eye in order to see everything that happens in the world.

He has two sons, Balder by his first wife Frigg, and Thor by Jord. Odin also has several animals. His two ravens, Hugin and Munin (thought and memory), fly around the world and report back what they see. Sleipnir, the eight-legged horse, can run through all the worlds. Geri and Freki are Odin’s wolves.

He learned the magical art of prophecy from Freyja. Odin has a gold ring called Draupnir that is important to the gods.

## Odin’s Self-Sacrifice

Sitting on his throne, Hlidskjalf, with Frigg in the hall of Valhalla, Odin looked out across the whole world. But he wanted to know everything and gain wisdom and knowledge of things hidden from him. This desire drove him to sacrifice himself.

He sacrificed his eye in Mimir’s well and threw himself on his spear, Gungnir, in a kind of symbolic, ritual suicide. He then hanged himself in Yggdrasil, the tree of life, for nine days and nine nights in order to gain knowledge of other worlds and be able to understand the runes.

During his sacrificial actions, he saw visions and received secret wisdom. The magical knowledge he gained made him able to:

- Cure the sick.
- Calm storms.
- Turn weapons against his attackers.
- Make women fall in love.
- Render dangerous troll women harmless – often just with a look.

Odin was also a shapeshifter, meaning that he could change shape. He could fall into an ecstatic trance and send out his soul, allowing him to adopt the form of another person or an animal. While his body lay in a trance, he could travel as a bird, a four-legged animal, a fish, or a snake through all the worlds and to far-off places.

Odin is often portrayed as a charming man who enjoys drinking mead and wine. However, he was accused of “unmanly behaviour” when he “beat the drum and practised prophecy” – something associated with women. The fact that he was a seer and a man provoked disgust in some quarters.

## Odin in *God of War*

In the *God of War* video game series, Odin is portrayed as a complex and manipulative figure. As the All-Father, he exerts immense influence across the Nine Realms, using fear, cunning, and force to maintain his dominance. He is obsessed with knowledge and power, often at the expense of others.

### Key Traits in *God of War*:

1. **Manipulation and Control:**
   - Odin is depicted as a master manipulator, leveraging both fear and deceit to maintain control over the realms and their inhabitants.
   - His actions often involve coercing or threatening others into submission, including family members like Thor and Balder.

2. **Relentless Pursuit of Knowledge:**
   - True to his mythological roots, Odin’s thirst for knowledge drives many of his actions in the game.
   - His pursuit of the secret of the runes and the hidden prophecies about Ragnarok reflects his obsession with foreseeing and controlling his destiny.

3. **Conflict with Kratos and Atreus:**
   - Odin’s paranoia about his potential downfall brings him into conflict with Kratos and his son Atreus (Loki).
   - Odin’s attempts to manipulate Atreus reveal his desperation to sway events in his favor.

4. **Relationship with the Realms:**
   - Odin’s tyranny over the realms is evident in the suffering of their inhabitants. For instance, the Vanir gods despise him for his betrayal during the Aesir-Vanir war.
   - His role in imprisoning Mimir and other acts of cruelty showcases his ruthlessness.

### Symbolism in the Game:
- Odin’s single-minded focus on knowledge and control parallels his mythological sacrifices but highlights his darker, more tyrannical traits.
- His character embodies the dangers of unchecked power and the consequences of valuing knowledge over compassion.

Through *God of War’s* narrative, Odin serves as both a formidable adversary and a reflection of the themes of power, family, and fate.
