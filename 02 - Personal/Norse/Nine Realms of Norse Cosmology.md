Norse cosmology divided the universe into nine realms. The center of the universe was the great world-tree Yggdrasil and the nine realms either spread out from the tree or existed in levels stretching from the roots down and, marginally, side-to-side.

Earlier Norse works (known as Eddic and Skaldic poetry) assume a knowledge of the cosmology and do not bother much with descriptions of locations or, in some cases, even specifics of what the realms were like and, because of this, and the fact that Norse [religion](https://www.worldhistory.org/religion/) had no written scripture, some of the realms are less clear than others.

Norse religious belief was characterised by the concept of _síður_ (SEE-thur) (meaning “custom” or “habit”) in that it was fully integrated into the lives of the people. One would not attend service in anything like a church but would observe worship of the gods in one's own home, in a clearing in the woods, or in some sacred place of chthonic power. Even though there is evidence that temples to the gods existed, there is no record of what services or rituals performed there were like.

The Icelandic mythographer Snorri Sturluson $(1179-1241 \;CE)$ finally wrote the Norse sagas but was a Christian writing for a Christian audience and so altered the original material. Those alterations resulted in the addition of the concept of the afterlife realm of **Hel**.  

### The Original Nine Realms (Pre-Christian Norse Tradition): 
1. **Asgard** – Realm of the Aesir. 
2. **Alfheim** – Realm of the Bright Elves. 
3. **Jotunheim** – Realm of the Giants. 
4. **Midgard** – Realm of Humans. 
5. **Muspelheim/Muspell** – Realm of Fire or Chaos. 
6. **Nidavellir** – Realm of the Dwarves. 
7. **Niflheim** – Realm of Ice and Mist (possibly with a lower realm, Niflhel). 
8. **Svartalfheim** – Realm of the Black Elves. 
9. **Vanaheim** – Realm of the Vanir.

***After Snorri's work, the nine realms changed as he seems to have confused the black elves with the dwarves and merged Nidavellir with Svartalfheim as a single realm while adding the concept of Hel as the most populous realm of the afterlife and making other changes.***
### The Nine Realms According to Snorri Sturluson: 
1. **Asgard** – Realm of the Aesir, connected to Midgard by the rainbow bridge Bifrost.  [[Asgard]]
2. **Alfheim** – Realm of the Elves. [[Alfheim]]
3. **Hel** – Realm of those who died of illness, old age, or non-battle deaths. [[Hel]]
4. **Jotunheim** – Realm of the Giants and Frost Giants. [[Jotunheim]]
5. **Midgard** – Realm of Humans, located between Asgard and Jotunheim. [[Midgard]]
6. **Muspelheim** – Realm of Fire, home to Surtr and his forces. [[Muspelheim]]
7. **Nidavellir/Svartalfheim** – Realm of the Dwarves beneath the earth.[[Nidavellir or Svartalfheim]]
8. **Niflheim** – Realm of Ice, Snow, and Mist near Muspelheim.  [[Niflheim]]
9. **Vanaheim** – Realm of the Vanir.  [[Vanaheim]]


## The World Tree & Creation

Before anything existed, there was only the tree Yggdrasil and the void. Its mentioned nowhere of who, or what created the tree of the world but all nine realms existed in and around its roots. Its assumed to have grown from a misty void of Ginnungagap which was bordered on one side by fiery Muspelheim and on the other by icy Niflheim. At some point, the fires of Muspelheim began to melt the ice of Niflheim and two entities emerged from the realm of mist: Ymir the giant and Audhumla the cow.

Audhumla, the primordial cow, sustained herself by licking salty ice blocks. As she licked, she uncovered Búri, who was trapped within the ice. Over three days of licking, Búri gradually emerged—first his hair, then his head, and finally his whole body.

Buri had a son (no mention is made of how) named Borr who mated with the giantess Bestla (who also appears from nowhere). Bestla gave birth to the first of the gods: [[ODIN]], Vili, and Ve. While this was going on, Ymir gave birth to the giants through the process of autogamy (self-fertilization). While he sleeps, a male and female are born from his left armpit and a son comes from his legs; these will be the ancestors of the giants.

Odin and his brothers kill Ymir and the giants are drowning in Ymir's blood. After Ymir is dead, Odin, Vili, and Ve drag his body to the void of Ginnungagap where they create the world from his corpse and, later, the first man (Ask) and first woman (Embla) from two trees. At this same time, it seems, the nine realms were also created.
